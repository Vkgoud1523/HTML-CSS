<p>Blockchain technologies can improve data integrity and robustness, enable decentralized, peer-to-peer transactions, and establish reliable digital identities for vehicles, components and consumers. This is accomplished through a number of capabilities</p>

<ul>
<li>Verify vehicle identity and vehicle history</li>

               <li>Track auto components through the supply chain</li>

              <li> Automate machine payments</li>

              <li> Facilitate car and ride sharing</li>

              <li> Support usage-based insurance and taxes</li>
</ul>

<p>Blockchain technology has potential for many different areas of the hospitality and travel industry from tracking luggage to identifying passengers, ensuring secure traceable payments and enabling customer loyalty programs to run better </p>

<ul>
<li>Validating Passengers Identity</li>
<li> Tracking Missing Luggage</li>
<li> Trucking.</li>
<li> Ride Hailing</li>
</ul>

<div>
<h3>Validating Passengers Identity</h3>

<p>The widespread adoption of e-Passports in particular has reduced the opportunity for identity fraud.</p>


<p>Biometric data, including face and fingerprints, is digitally encoded within a chip embedded in the physical ePassport book enabling live biometric checks of the holder, ensuring that the person carrying the passport is the owner.</p>

<p>These biometric checks can be used at every point of the journey . Once enrolled, after the first touch point in the journey through the airport, there is no need for the passenger to present a boarding pass, a passport or travel documents again. </p>

<h3>Tracking Missing Luggage</h3>

<p>The airlines lose millions of bags each year costing them hundreds of millions of dollars each year</P>

<p>Airlines must adopt smart technologies through, IoT, Cloud and blockchain to reduce baggage mishandling</p>

<p>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID).
 Blockchain helps overcome the above problems faced by both entities. The RFID tags is used to sense the location of the luggage and track them at checkpoints and simultaneously update the blockchain.</p>

<p>Blockchain Technology can be translated as a timestamped record and hence can be used to trace the location of the bag at a particular point in time after it is added to the blockchain</p>

</div>

<h3>Trucking</h3>

<p>One of the challenges of the transportation industry is a reliance on paper-based, manual processes</p>

 <p>Blockchain is a peer-to-peer network that connects trading partners directly.  It offers an end-to-end solution for companies to document and record transactions between trusted parties in a secure and permanent way.</p>

  <p> As an integral component of a blockchain-based system, smart contracts can automatically enforce stakeholder agreed rules and process corresponding steps of fulfillment.</p>

   <p> When contract conditions are met, pre-specified and agreed actions occurs automatically</p>

<h2> Public Sector</h2>

 <p>         The management of public services is yet another area where blockchain can help lessen paper-based processes, minimize fraud, and increase accountability between authorities and those they serve.</p>

<img src="https://cdn.consensys.net/uploads/consensys-government-and-the-public-sector-social.jpg" width='500'>

<p>While Organizations are only accountable to their shareholders, Governments are accountable to a country and its people.</p>
                              
                    <p>   The technologies can be leveraged in government and the public sector to streamline operations and enhance transparency and accountability. Use cases range from Self-Sovereign digital identity, to Electronic health records and Central banking.</p>

<ul>
      
<li> Government & public records</li>

    <li>  Digital identity </li>

      <li> Registries</li>

     <li>  Voting</li>

       <li> Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)</li>

</ul>

<div>

<h3> Digital Identity</h3>

<p> Blockchain-based identity management  .As a simple example, a municipal officer scanning a citizen’s ID could confirm her name and, for instance, city of residence, without revealing any other sensitive information </p>

</div>
<div>
<h3> Registers</h3>

<p>Managing registries with blockchain-supported distributed ledgers provides the needed transparency to eliminate fraud and corruption</p>
                          <p> Republic of Georgia, which was the first nation to implement blockchain based land registries (meaning real-estate deals can be completed in days rather than months.)</P>
</div>
<div>
<h3> Voting</h3>

<p>The e-voting system we use now is susceptible to hacks or meddling from the organizations that create the infrastructure. </p>
              <p>  If the voting database will exist on the blockchain that millions of nodes will support simultaneously. This ensures that the data cannot be changed or manipulated. Also, due to the robust encryption and decentralization, the voting database will be incorruptible, and each voting record will be easily verifiable.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)</h3>
 <p> A central bank digital currency is the digital form of a country's fiat currency.</p>

    <p>  A CBDC is issued and regulated by a nation's monetary authority or central bank.</p>

      <p>CBDCs promote financial inclusion and simplify the implementation of monetary and fiscal policy.</p>

    <p>   As a centralized form of currency, they may not anonymize transactions as some cryptocurrencies do.</p>

    <p>   Many countries are exploring how CBDCs will affect their economies, existing financial networks, and stability.</p>

<h2>Education,Communications& Services</h2>

<p>Blockchain gives students ownership of their personal records, allowing them to control their academic identity.</p>

                        <p> Academic blockchain is a completely distributed and decentralized system that requires all participating peers to install node applications which facilitates the node to access the student's records in the blockchain</p>

<img src="https://mlxeddm1pf2i.i.optimole.com/BGlfpWk.lSSh~3ef84/w:500/h:340/q:mauto/https://www.truscholar.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-uses-cases.jpg" width='500'>

<p>Blockchain can allow educators to publish content openly as well as tracking any re-use, without putting limitations on the source material. With Blockchain, the agreements of automatic transfer of credits can be written as smart-contracts.</p>


                   <p>     Libraries could deploy a blockchain-based system layered with “smart contract” code to facilitate the indexing and sharing of community items (tools, cars, expertise) in a sharing network.</p>


                   <p>     A blockchain solution can allow telecom service providers to store unique device/SIM data on the blockchain along with customer profile, block a stolen device instantaneously and also keep third parties informed of any change of status of a device.</p>
